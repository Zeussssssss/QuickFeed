      <h1 class="heading"> Brief Overview </h1>
      <p> This website application is built towards an audience of students and professors/teachers. The application is designed to allow students to passively send constructive criticism/feedback to a lecturer, meaning there is minimal effort needed
        by students to use this application.
      </p>
      <p> The goal of this application is for users to enter keystrokes/click a button to produce an automated message with a timestamp to be sent to the database. For example, if a user wanted to say “[LECTURER] is confusing at [TIMESTAMP] by
        [USER]” or “[LECTURER] moved too fast at [TIMESTAMP] by [USER]” they would simply hit a key/click a button to send a message that auto-populates that field based off set config to the database. At the end of a lecture period all models of
        messages in the database will be compiled/analyzed for a view by the professor through an email.

      <p>Even though we did our best to make this website user friendly, there can be stuff that still might be a little tricky to understand. Therefore, we have made this brief guide to help you out whenever and wherever you get stuck!</p>
      <div id="Login-Signup-instr">
        <h1> Login/Signup Steps(for both students and instructors)</h1>
        <p> The process for login in to an accouny(or creating a new account), is pretty simple and is quite similar to the login sections of other websites. The only thing that the user should keep in mind is that they should not forget to
          <b> check the option to use QuickFeed as an Instructor</b> in both Signup and login pages if they wish to use the added functionality that an instructor account would get. Also, instructors will not be able to login unless they select
          the login as instructor option.
        </p>
        <p> The links to the signup and the login pages are present on the main home page(in both the navigation bar and the main body of the page), and also both the pages have links to each other.
